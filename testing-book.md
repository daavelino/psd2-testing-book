## Authority
The [COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2018/389](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32018R0389), in its CHAPTER 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS, Article 1 states that:

>This Regulation establishes the requirements to be complied with by **payment service providers** for the purpose of implementing security measures which enable them to do the following:
>
>(a) **apply the procedure** of strong customer authentication **in accordance with Article 97 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366**;
>
>(b) **exempt the application** of the security requirements of strong customer authentication, subject to specified and limited conditions based on the level of risk, the amount and the recurrence of the payment transaction and of the payment channel used for its execution;
>
>(c) **protect** the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service user's **personalised security credentials**;
>
>(d) establish **common and secure open standards for the communication** between account servicing payment service providers, payment initiation service providers, account information service providers, payers, payees and other payment service providers in relation to the provision and use of payment services in application of Title IV of Directive (EU) 2015/2366.

- **‘strong customer authentication’** means an authentication based on the use of two or more elements categorised as knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user possesses) and inherence (something the user is) that are independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others, and is designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data; (Title I, art. 4, item 30 of the [DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2366](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015L2366))
